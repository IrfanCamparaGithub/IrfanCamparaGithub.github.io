    <h1 id="title">How have Food Imports and Shipping Changed In Recent Years and Why Does it Contribute to Your Plate?</h1>

    <h2>Audience & Intent:</h2>

    <p>Food imports and their impact on the entire world are often overlooked as we usually go to the grocery store, pick something out, and buy it without much thought. The reality of this overlooked topic is that small changes in shipping, climate or politics can have major effects on the price, availability and nutritional quality of the foods that people consume on a daily basis. Anywhere from New York City to Boise Idaho, the food imports and their respective suppliers have major changes on your grocery bill, diet and access to basic everyday items.</p>

    <p>This story was meant to be for a broader audience, but it speaks to these groups most:</p>

    <p>International Economist whose entire career is built upon analyzing global economies and trade relationships, and how these relationships drive microeconomic changes within countries and households<br>
    Policymakers and Analysts who rely on important and easy to understand data to understand how policy or economic/climate events have shifted food security in the past<br>
    Domestic and International farmers who want to understand competition, opportunity and how the U.S market depends on a foreign supply<br>
    American Consumers who want to understand why the price of chocolate just rose 50%, why food sources become plentiful or scarce, and how geopolitics and climate affect their everyday meal</p>

    <p>What we want to do is clear, we want to give an intuitive story on how the U.S food import system works, which countries we rely on most, how these patterns have shifted across the decades, and how all of this determines what food graces our plates. With data visualization and accessibility at the forefront of our research, we will make sure that as many people as possible hear and understand our message.</p>

    <h2 id="data">Data For This Project:</h2>

    <p>The dataset that will be used is the publicly available food imports data published yearly by the USDA. The data can be accessed here:https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/us-food-imports .<br>
    This dataset includes key data points such as:<br>
    Import values for major edible food categories<br>
    Ports of entry<br>
    Origin Countries<br>
    Annual shifts in category levels volume and value<br>
    Longer term historical trends</p>

    <p>Since the dataset is maintained annually and is widely referenced within policy changes, trade journals and economic research, it allows us to have a reliable basis for identifying patterns, disruptions and emerging trends.</p>

    <h2 id="food-origins">Where Does Your Food Really Come From?</h2>

    <p>To truly start understanding the complex U.S food system, it would be best to start with a high level overview of the countries that contribute most to the American food system. The sankey diagram which will be below visualizes the flow of major food categories from the respective origin countries into the U.S. The diagram also allows you to hover over each food category and country of origin so you can get a more detailed view.</p>

    <div class="flourish-embed flourish-sankey" data-src="visualisation/26082792">
        <script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script>
        <noscript><img src="https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/26082792/thumbnail" width="100%" alt="sankey visualization" /></noscript>
    </div>

    <p>From the sankey diagram, several key patterns are hopefully clear:</p>

    <p>Canada and Mexico are the two major trade partners for the U.S, and this relationship allows us to reflect on the deep and longstanding integration of these two countries into the U.S supply chain<br>
    Produce and animal products are the most interconnected categories which reflects upon the U.S and its changing year-round climate which requires trade in order to have year round availability for major food categories<br>
    Large portions of certain foods come from countries that are not spoken enough about, and some of these include the Ivory Coast, Chile, Guatemala, etc</p>

    <p>This diagram again allows us to see how the U.S relies on a deeply globalized trade system, and foods that often appear local are often coming from a country you might have never even heard of!</p>

    <h2 id="global-map">World Map For The Largest 3 Food Imports Into The United States:</h2>

    <p>Below is a quick map chart showing the major importers for the 3 largest categories of food imports for the United States (Grain, Vegetables and Fruit).</p>

    <div class="flourish-embed flourish-map" data-src="visualisation/26082533">
        <script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script>
        <noscript><img src="https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/26082533/thumbnail" width="100%" alt="map visualization" /></noscript>
    </div>

    <p>The story told above in the map tells us three main things:</p>

    <p>Grains are a food category which rely heavily on North American partners and a few international producers as well<br>
    Vegetables show a strong regional pattern in where Mexico and Canada make up almost all of the imports due to proximity and climate compatibility<br>
    Fruits have a greater global distribution with inflows from Central America, South America and even parts of Asia</p>

    <p>Overall this map highlights that the American diet does not depend as much on international partners for meat products. The major portion of our reliance on international trade is produce and carbohydrate staples rather than livestock. This reliance on international carbohydrates makes sense as these staples are often cheaper to transport, require less resources, and are easier to preserve.</p>

    <h2 id="inflation">Inflation, Inflation, Inflation, How Food Prices Have Suffered From This Dreaded Term:</h2>

    <p>Inflation is a common culprit of many issues that Americans and citizens from across the world have to deal with, and will continue to deal with for the rest of eternity. Below is a playable line chart where you can view as a whole or hyper focus on a specific food group.</p>

    <div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/26080754">
        <script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script>
        <noscript><img src="https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/26080754/thumbnail" width="100%" alt="chart visualization" /></noscript>
    </div>

    <p>While we yet again won’t delve into major details. We will explain some of the specific major changes and the respective reasoning behind such changes.</p>

    <p>2008: A major downward spike is seen. The reasoning as such should hopefully be self-explanatory, but in case it is not. The 2008 financial crisis which was caused by synthetic securities banks created that were backed by horrible mortgages finally broke and caused the entire global economy to melt. This of course caused the entire global economy to slow and deflation for almost every single item to ensue.<br>
    2011: A direct contrast to our previous example of 2008, a major spike in almost every single food category was seen. This spike can mainly be attributed to extreme weather events, biofuel booms and the weakness of the U.S Dollar. A Combination of these three macroeconomic headwinds resulted in a major spike for food imports, and likely caused many Americans to have much less food on their plates.<br>
    2020: Again another sharp spike is seen in 2020 and this is mainly attributed to the COVID-19 pandemic which led to mass money printing and reduction of interest rates to ensure the global economy would not crash. As such, food import prices increased dramatically.<br>
    2024: While most food groups maintained stability. Cocoa and chocolate saw a massive spike. The reasoning behind this is that global production for cocoa fell by a large margin and tariffs on major producers like Ghana and the Ivory Coast also led to their major import (cocoa) to spike in price as well. (We can live without chocolate, right???)</p>

    <p>While there are many more nuanced spikes and crashes. These are the main events we consider relevant and hope are a little better explained now.</p>

    <h2 id="volume">Import Volume Changes Over Time</h2>

    <p>Ok, so now that we have a snapshot of the largest food imports by country, map for the largest food groups and moving price line chart, it is now time to see how different categories have shifted in overall volume throughout time.</p>

    <div class="flourish-embed flourish-bar-chart-race" data-src="visualisation/26081763">
        <script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script>
        <noscript><img src="https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/26081763/thumbnail" width="100%" alt="bar-chart-race visualization" /></noscript>
    </div>

    <p>The main trends can be defined by four key points:</p>

    <p>Live meats imports dominated in the turn of the century which shows our previous reliance on imported livestock<br>
    As the century began to age, fruits and vegetables overtook the overall meat imports, and this is mainly due to crop diversification, shifting dietary preferences and trade agreement changes<br>
    Grains however consistently remained a top category which shows their stability and dependency<br>
    Recent debates over Argentinian beef reflect ongoing concerns regarding domestic meat prices, and this is a future trend which might bring us back to the trade activity we saw at the turn of the century</p>

    <p>Overall, these long term shifts show that we have a dynamic food system that is able to respond to climate changes, technology and consumer behavior rather than being static</p>

    <h2 id="final">Final Remarks:</h2>

    <p>Food is more than a daily need, food is a global system that we hardly think about which is shaped by international cooperation, shipping networks, trade deals and economic recessions/depressions. This short exploration allows us to see that the contents of our grocery cart depend on the decisions made across multiple continents, oceans and islands. These patterns are important as it empowers:</p>

    <p>Consumers who want clarity regarding politics and rising costs<br>
    Policymakers who want to ensure we have a stable, fair and resilient food system<br>
    Producers who make decisions based on competition and opportunity<br>
    Researchers who analyze key vulnerabilities and long term trends</p>

    <p>From financial crises, extreme weather, and even rises in trends like biofuel, it is key that we understand how these major and micro trends shape what ends up on our plate. Visualizing these patterns with accessibility at the helm allows us to see the food system not as some hard to understand black box, but as a dynamic network in which stability is key for every individual.</p>
