<h1 id="title">Title: How has Food Imports and Shipping Changed In Recent Years and Why Does it Contribute to Your Plate?</h1>

<h2>Audience & Intent:</h2>

<p>This food import tale is designed for essentially everyone within the world. While that may seem generic, food import and international logistics impacts the lives of everyone whether you know it or not. Food imports can make or break diet culture, pricing and the overall wellness of individuals within a country. While there are many different individuals who may be interested in reading such a report, the key audience members would be international economics who may be focused on food logistics, farmers across the globe who want to see what the U.S is importing in most and American citizens who want to see which foods are projected to increase, decrease or maintain their current price and country of origin. The main goal is that these users are able to get a sense of which countries the U.S relies on the most for major food imports, how important food categories and importing countries have shifted over time, how the U.S food prices impact the world and vice versa, and how current and past political policies have shifted food import specifics such as importing countries, price and highest importing volume.</p>

<h2 id="data">Data For This Project:</h2>

<p>The dataset that will be used is the publicly available food imports data published yearly by the USDA. The data can be accessed here:
<a href="https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/us-food-imports" target="_blank">https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/us-food-imports</a>.
This data is published on an annual basis and contains key information such as import values of edible products that enter U.S. ports and the products’ origin of shipment.</p>

<h2 id="sankey">Where Does Your Food Really Come From?</h2>

<p>A good place to start understanding the complex food products that come in and out every day into the United States is an overall snapshot of the situation. Below is an interactive Sankey diagram created on Flourish.</p>

<p>Some key things that you will notice at first glance are our major food import partners being Canada and Mexico, with their respective imports ranging from vegetables, dairy, animals and more. You might also see that the rest of the world contributes a massive amount of food to our food supply. While we will not delve into the specific imports country by country, you can explore the interactive chart to see the breakdowns.</p>

<h2 id="map">World Map For The Largest 3 Food Imports Into The United States:</h2>

<p>Below is a map chart showing the major importers for the three largest categories of food imports for the United States: grain, vegetables and fruit. This map tells us a story about how the majority of our consumption as Americans relies heavily on produce and carbohydrates. Canada and Mexico, alongside Guatemala, Peru, Spain and China, make up large portions of raw volume for the foods that go on our plates daily.</p>

<h2 id="inflation">Inflation, Inflation, Inflation, How Food Prices Have Suffered From This Dreaded Term:</h2>

<p>Inflation affects citizens across the world in various ways. Below is a playable line chart where you can view food price trends as a whole or focus on specific food groups.</p>

<p>2008: A major downward spike appears. The 2008 financial crisis resulted in global slowdown and deflation for many sectors.</p>

<p>2011: A sharp spike in nearly all food categories occurred due to extreme weather events, biofuel expansion and a weak U.S. dollar.</p>

<p>2020: Another spike corresponding to the COVID-19 pandemic caused by monetary stimulus and reduced interest rates.</p>

<p>2024: Cocoa and chocolate prices surged due to declining global production and tariffs imposed on major producers such as Ghana and Ivory Coast.</p>

<h2 id="volume">Import Volume Changes Over Time</h2>

<p>Below is a bar chart race that shows how food categories have changed in total import volume throughout the years.</p>

<p>Major food groups at the beginning of the century were live meat animals, fruits and grains. Live meat animals declined in volume over time, while fruits and vegetables rose to lead the rankings in recent years. Other categories maintained relatively stable ordering.</p>

<h2 id="final">Final Remarks:</h2>

<p>This exploration shows that the food on our plates depends on complex logistics, economic and political systems. The United States relies heavily on global partners for critical food categories. These relationships shift due to prices, climate, policy changes and other factors. Understanding these dynamics enables consumers, policymakers and farmers to navigate a changing world where every decision influences food availability.</p>
